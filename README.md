The module uses the WCS1600 sensor and Voltage divider to provide precise current and voltage measurements upto 100A and 100V both AC and DC.

The module provides the voltage and current measurements along with Ah and Wh through serial UART. A simple software program on arduino can be used to read the data for every 1seconds.
